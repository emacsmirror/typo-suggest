This package is a [[https://www.datamuse.com/api/][datamuse api]] backend for fixing typos, getting suggestions and finding the correct word with ~helm~ or ~company-mode~.

* Installation
The melpa package is coming. If you want to try package early and you used straight.el, you can install directly in this snippet.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package typo-suggest
    :straight (typo-suggest :type git :host github :repo "kadircancetin/typo-suggest"))
#+end_src


* Usage
Use ~M-x typo-suggest-helm~ for helm completion. There is two helm actions. First one is insert the suggested completion which you can use with pressing the ~<Enter>~, second one is replace the current word under the cursor, wich you can use ~<TAB F2>~.

For company mode, type ~M-x typo-suggest-company~. If you want to make company-mode use typo-suggest all the time, you should add the typo-suggest-company to ~company-backends~.

For the purpose of trying the company use all the time typo-suggest, you can write your evaluate ~(setq company-backends '(typo-suggest-company)~ code. But we highly not advice to that. Don't add this setq line if you don't know what it is for.

* Customization
Variable ~typo-suggest-suggestion-count~ is for the count of suggestions from datamuse. You can upper or lower value for the your choice.

Variable ~typo-suggest-timeout~ is for the remote server timeout. If your connection is unstable, you may want to increase this value.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq typo-suggest-suggestion-count 20)
  (setq typo-suggest-timeout 1)
#+end_src

- [ ] Google translate integration.
