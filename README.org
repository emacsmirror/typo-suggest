This package is a [[https://www.datamuse.com/api/][datamuse api]] backend for fixing typos, getting suggestions and finding the correct word with ~helm~ or ~company-mode~.

* Installation

[[[[https://melpa.org/#/typo-suggest][file:https://melpa.org/packages/typo-suggest-badge.svg]]

Package is avalible in melpa. So you can install directly =M-x typo-suggest= or if you use use-package =(use-package typo-suggest)=.

* Usage
Use =M-x typo-suggest-helm= for helm completion.

For company mode backend, type =M-x typo-suggest-company-mode=. It will activate or deactivate typo-suggest back-end.

* Customization
You can change the backends with typo-suggest-default-search-method variable.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq typo-suggest-default-search-method 'datamuse)
  (setq typo-suggest-default-search-method 'ispell)
#+end_src

Variable ~typo-suggest-suggestion-count~ is for the count of suggestions from datamuse. You can upper or lower value for the your choice.

Variable ~typo-suggest-timeout~ is for the remote server timeout. If your connection is unstable, you may want to increase this value.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq typo-suggest-suggestion-count 20)
  (setq typo-suggest-timeout 1)
#+end_src

* Common Issues
Company mode or helm mode is not running asyncronous. Helm is not frustrating but ~company-idle-delay~ varible is so low, company mode is not fast on ~datamuse~ backend.

* Road Map
- [ ] Google translate integration.
- [X] Ivy integration.
